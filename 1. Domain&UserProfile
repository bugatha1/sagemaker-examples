CreateDomain:
  Creates a Domain used by Amazon SageMaker Studio. 
  A domain consists of an associated Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) volume,

  and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) configurations. 
  An AWS account is limited to one domain per region. 
  Users within a domain can share notebook files and other artifacts with each other.
